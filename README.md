**Case study : Banking Operations**

Develop a banking transaction application.

The application should consist of the following details:

1. It should have unique number and store information about its account holder â€“ First name, last name and age.

2. It should store information about the balance of the account, the interest of the account and the type of the interest (complex and simple year interest).

3. It should prompt the user for the needed information and after validation it should create a new bank account.

4. It should support add, withdraw and display account operations.

5. It should maintain a minimum balance.

6. The withdrawn should not be happened when the account has not sufficient balance.

7. Calculate the amount based on interest type.

Note:

Follow proper naming conventions.

Use OOPs concepts wherever applicable

Create separate class to store user details and bank accounts.

Encapsulate the class variables using getter and setter method.

Use constructors wherever applicable for initializing the class variables.

Implement inheritance and polymorphism wherever required.

**Exception handling**

1. Implement exception handling mechanism for the above application.

2. Create and use your own custom exceptions:

Insufficient Funds Exception

Non Existing Bank Account Exception

3. **Raise the user defined or custom exception when the account has not sufficient balance and for invalid bank account and handle it.**

4. If someone tries to create a bank account with invalid information an appropriate exception should be thrown.
